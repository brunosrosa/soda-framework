# SOP-001: Product Discovery (Genesis)

**Phase:** Phase 0 (Discovery)
**Role:** Product Researcher

## Context
"Fall in love with the problem, not the solution." - Uri Levine.

## The CSD Matrix
- **Certainties:** Facts backed by data.
- **Assumptions:** Risks we accept (for now).
- **Doubts:** Questions we MUST answer before building.

## Job To Be Done (JTBD)
Focus on the *outcome* the user wants, not the tool.
*Example:* "I want a hole in the wall, not a drill."
