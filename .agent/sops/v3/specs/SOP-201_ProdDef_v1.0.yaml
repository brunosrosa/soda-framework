  ## 1. Primary Objective
  Define WHAT to build. Turn strategy into requirements.

  ## 2. Execution Protocol
  1. **User Story Mapping:**
     - Backbone (User Journey).
     - Ribs (Features).
  2. **Prioritization (MoSCoW):**
     - **M**ust have (MVP).
     - **S**hould have (MLP).
     - **C**ould have.
     - **W**on't have (v1).
  3. **Spec Writing:** Create clear Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin).

  ## 3. Guardrails
  - ⛔ **MUST NOT:** Scope creep. Stick to the Lean Canvas.
  - ⚠️ **WARNING:** If logic is complex, request a flowchart.

  ## 4. Definition of Done
  - [ ] User Story Map created.
  - [ ] MVP defined.
  - [ ] Backlog populated.
