# SOP-801: Feedback Loop (Evolution)

**Phase:** Phase 8 (Evolution)
**Role:** Product Manager

## Context
The software is never "done". It is a living organism.

## The OODA Loop
- **Observe:** Look at the data.
- **Orient:** Update your mental model (CSD Matrix).
- **Decide:** Choose the next move.
- **Act:** Build it.

## Killing Features
Don't be afraid to remove code. Less code = Less bugs.
If a feature has < 1% usage after 3 months, kill it.
