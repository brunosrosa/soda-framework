  ## 1. Primary Objective
  Validate the problem and understand the user (CSD Matrix).

  ## 2. Execution Protocol
  1. **Research:** Search for similar solutions and market gaps.
  2. **CSD Matrix:**
     - **Certezas:** What we know is true.
     - **Suposições:** What we *think* is true (Needs validation).
     - **Dúvidas:** What we don't know.
  3. **Personas:** Define who feels the pain (Job To Be Done).

  ## 3. Guardrails
  - ⛔ **MUST NOT:** Build features. Only validate problems.
  - ⚠️ **WARNING:** Bias alert. Look for disconfirming evidence.

  ## 4. Definition of Done
  - [ ] CSD Matrix created.
  - [ ] Target Persona defined.
  - [ ] Problem Statement is clear.
